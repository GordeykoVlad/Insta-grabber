# Insta-grabber

Hello, due to the fact that Instagram closed API for developers I'm writing here my own API... 
I know there are a lot of already existing projects to doing that, but I need some specific data for my research work. 
So I'm doing it. 
At the first moment, it will unstructured since I need only functionality, later I will make it more structured. 
And finally I'll try to implement a desktop application for communication through Dir.
